2. For best results:
   - Be specific and clear about what you want
   - Provide context and examples when needed
   - Break complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Specify the desired format for the response

### Understanding Responses

Each response includes:

1. The AI-generated text
2. Model information (provider and model name)
3. Token usage statistics (input, output, and total tokens)
4. A unique response ID for reference

### Conversation History

Your conversation history is displayed in the chat interface, allowing you to:

1. Review previous prompts and responses
2. Copy text from responses
3. Export conversations as text or markdown files
4. Start a new conversation when needed

## Managing API Keys

API keys allow you to access the ColonyCraft AI API programmatically.

### Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to the API Keys section in your account settings
2. Click "Create New API Key"
3. Provide a name for the key to help you identify its purpose
4. Select the appropriate scopes (permissions) for the key
5. Set an expiration date (optional but recommended)
6. Click "Generate Key"
7. Copy and store the key securely - it will only be shown once

### Using API Keys Securely

1. Never expose your API key in client-side code
2. Set appropriate scopes to limit what the key can access
3. Rotate keys regularly for enhanced security
4. Monitor key usage for unexpected activity

### Revoking an API Key

1. Go to the API Keys section in your account settings
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click "Revoke" next to the key
4. Confirm the action when prompted

## Understanding Usage Limits

ColonyCraft AI employs a token-based usage system.

### Token Basics

- Tokens are units of text (roughly 4 characters per token in English)
- Both input (prompts) and output (responses) consume tokens
- Different models have different token limits per request
- Your usage is displayed in real-time in the interface

### Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage, ColonyCraft AI implements rate limits:

1. Per-minute request limits
2. Daily token usage caps
3. Concurrent request limits

If you hit a rate limit, you'll receive a notification and can resume after a brief waiting period.

## Advanced Features

### Prompt Templates

Create reusable prompt templates to streamline common tasks:

1. Go to the Templates section
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Design your template with placeholders for variable content
4. Save and use the template in your conversations

### Batch Processing

For processing multiple prompts efficiently:

1. Navigate to the Batch Processing section
2. Upload a CSV file with your prompts
3. Select the provider and model
4. Start the batch job
5. Download results when processing is complete

### API Integration

Integrate ColonyCraft AI into your applications:

1. Generate an API key with appropriate scopes
2. Use the RESTful API to send requests
3. Process responses in your application
4. Monitor usage through the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Problems**
   - Ensure you're using the correct email and password
   - Check if your account has been verified
   - Try resetting your password if necessary

2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - Wait until your rate limit refreshes
   - Optimize your prompts to use fewer tokens
   - Consider upgrading your account for higher limits

3. **Model Unavailability**
   - Some models may be temporarily unavailable due to provider maintenance
   - Try selecting an alternative model from the same or different provider
   - Check the system status page for any announced outages

4. **Response Errors**
   - If you receive an error in response to your prompt, try rephrasing it
   - Ensure your prompt doesn't violate content policies
   - Break complex prompts into simpler ones
