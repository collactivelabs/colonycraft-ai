# Data Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for managing data migrations in the ColonyCraft AI platform. Proper data migration is crucial for maintaining system integrity while evolving the application's data model over time.

## Migration Types

### Schema Migrations

Schema migrations involve changes to the database structure, including:

- Creating or dropping tables
- Adding, modifying, or removing columns
- Adding or removing constraints, indexes, or triggers
- Changing column data types

### Data Migrations

Data migrations involve transforming existing data within the database, including:

- Moving data between tables
- Normalizing or denormalizing data structures
- Enriching data with additional information
- Cleaning or correcting stored values
- Converting data formats

## Migration Tooling

### Alembic for Schema Migrations

Alembic is used for managing schema migrations due to its:

1. **Integration with SQLAlchemy**: Works seamlessly with our ORM
2. **Migration dependency tracking**: Handles complex migration graphs
3. **Automated migration generation**: Detects schema changes
4. **Branching support**: Manages parallel development branches
5. **Revision tracking**: Provides detailed migration history

### Custom Python Scripts for Complex Data Migrations

For complex data transformations that can't be handled by Alembic alone:

1. Create idempotent Python scripts that can be run multiple times safely
2. Implement transaction support to ensure data consistency
3. Include proper error handling and logging
4. Add progress reporting for long-running migrations
5. Create validation steps to ensure data integrity

## Migration Workflow

### Development Phase

1. **Migration Planning**
   - Identify required schema changes
   - Determine data transformation needs
   - Assess impact on existing functionality
   - Plan backward compatibility measures

2. **Migration Implementation**
   - Create Alembic migration scripts
   - Develop supplementary data migration scripts
   - Update application code to work with new schema
   - Implement backward compatibility logic

3. **Local Testing**
   - Test migrations on developer machines
   - Verify application functionality with migrated data
   - Measure migration performance on realistic data volumes
   - Validate migration rollback procedures

### Deployment Phase

1. **Pre-Deployment Validation**
   - Run migrations on a staging environment with production-like data
   - Verify application functionality in the staging environment
   - Measure migration duration with production-scale data
   - Perform application performance testing after migration

2. **Backup Procedures**
   - Create full database backup before migration
   - Set up point-in-time recovery capability
   - Document restore procedures in case of failure

3. **Deployment Execution**
   - Schedule migration during low-traffic periods
   - Use rolling deployments when possible to minimize downtime
   - Monitor migration progress in real-time
   - Have rollback plan ready in case of issues

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Validate data integrity after migration
   - Verify critical application functionality
   - Monitor system performance for regression
   - Check for any error or warning logs

## Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy

For high-availability requirements, we implement a zero-downtime migration approach:

### 1. Backward-Compatible Database Changes

- Add new tables or columns without removing existing ones
- Create temporary views to maintain compatibility with old code
- Use database triggers to keep old and new structures in sync

### 2. Multi-Phase Application Deployment

**Phase 1: Preparation**
- Deploy application code that can work with both old and new schema
- Read from old schema, write to both old and new

**Phase 2: Migration**
- Run data migration to populate new schema elements from old ones
- Verify data consistency between old and new schemas

**Phase 3: Switchover**
- Update application to read from new schema, still write to both

**Phase 4: Cleanup**
- Once all systems are reading from new schema, remove old schema elements
- Remove dual-write code and compatibility layers

## Handling Large Data Migrations

For migrations involving large datasets:

### 1. Batching

- Process data in small batches (e.g., 1,000-10,000 rows)
- Use checkpoints to track migration progress
- Implement resume capability for interrupted migrations

### 2. Parallel Processing

- Partition data by ID ranges or other criteria
- Run multiple migration workers simultaneously
- Use resource limiting to prevent database overload

### 3. Background Processing

- Implement migrations as background tasks
- Use message queues for migration task distribution
- Allow application to remain operational during migrations

## Testing Migrations

### Unit Testing

- Test individual migration functions
- Verify data transformation logic
- Ensure idempotence of migration scripts

### Integration Testing

- Test complete migration sequence
- Verify application compatibility with migrated schema
- Test both upgrade and downgrade paths

### Performance Testing

- Measure migration duration with realistic data volumes
- Identify bottlenecks and optimize migration code
- Set expectations for production migration timing

## Monitoring and Logging

### Migration-Specific Logging

- Log start and completion of each migration step
- Record counts of processed records
- Track any data anomalies or validation failures
- Capture performance metrics for optimization

### Alerting

- Set up alerts for migration failures
- Monitor migration progress against expected timeline
- Notify operations team of any unexpected issues

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollbacks

- Implement automated rollback functionality in migration scripts
- Test rollback procedures thoroughly
- Document known limitations of rollbacks

### Manual Recovery Procedures

- Document step-by-step recovery procedures
- Prepare SQL scripts for emergency fixes
- Train operations team on recovery steps

## Migration Documentation

Each migration should include comprehensive documentation:

### Technical Documentation

- Purpose of the migration
- Schema changes implemented
- Data transformations performed
- Dependencies on other migrations
- Known limitations or edge cases

### Operational Documentation

- Estimated runtime based on data volume
- Resource requirements (CPU, memory, disk)
- Monitoring instructions
- Rollback procedures
- Verification steps

## Scheduled vs. On-Demand Migrations

### Scheduled Migrations

- Applied automatically during deployment
- Used for simple schema changes
- Executed as part of CI/CD pipeline

### On-Demand Migrations

- Triggered manually by operations team
- Used for complex or long-running data transformations
- Scheduled during maintenance windows

## Migration Approval Process

For significant migrations, follow this approval process:

1. **Proposal**: Document migration plan including risk assessment
2. **Review**: Technical review by senior engineers
3. **Testing**: Validate in staging environment
4. **Approval**: Final sign-off by engineering lead
5. **Scheduling**: Coordination with operations team
6. **Execution**: Performed by authorized personnel
7. **Verification**: Post-migration validation

## Special Considerations

### Multi-Region Deployments

- Coordinate migrations across regions
- Consider using blue-green deployment strategies
- Implement database replication lag monitoring

### High-Volume Tables

- Assess impact on database performance
- Consider creating new tables and switching after migration
- Use temporary indexes to speed up migrations

### Third-Party Integrations

- Verify compatibility of migrated data with external systems
- Update integration documentation as needed
- Coordinate with partners if API changes are involved

## Conclusion

A well-planned data migration strategy is essential for maintaining system integrity while evolving the application. By following the processes outlined in this document, we can minimize risk and ensure smooth transitions between schema versions.
