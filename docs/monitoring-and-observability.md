# ColonyCraft AI Monitoring and Observability Guide

## Overview

This document serves as the main entry point for the ColonyCraft AI platform's monitoring and observability strategy. For better organization and maintenance, the detailed documentation has been split into multiple files located in the `docs/monitoring/` directory.

Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining system reliability, performance, and security while providing insights into user behavior and application health. Our comprehensive monitoring approach ensures that we can quickly detect and resolve issues, optimize performance, and ensure a high-quality user experience.

## Monitoring Pillars

Our monitoring strategy is built on four key pillars:

1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Tracking the health and performance of servers, containers, and cloud resources
2. **Application Monitoring**: Measuring the performance and reliability of application components
3. **User Experience Monitoring**: Understanding how users interact with the system
4. **Security Monitoring**: Detecting and responding to suspicious activities

## Documentation Structure

For detailed information on each aspect of our monitoring strategy, please refer to the following documents:

15. [Edge Case Monitoring](monitoring/15-edge-case-monitoring.md) - Handling rare but critical scenarios

## Key Components

Our monitoring infrastructure consists of the following key components:

1. **Prometheus**: Central metrics collection and storage
2. **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding
3. **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing across services
4. **ELK Stack**: Log aggregation and analysis
5. **Alertmanager**: Alert routing and notification
6. **Custom LLM Metrics**: Specialized metrics for AI service performance

## Implementation Approach

The monitoring system is being implemented in four phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Monitoring** - Basic system and application metrics
2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Observability** - Distributed tracing and expanded metrics
3. **Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring** - Anomaly detection and LLM-specific monitoring
4. **Phase 4: Automation and Optimization** - Self-healing and predictive monitoring

For a detailed implementation timeline and plan, refer to the [Implementation Plan](monitoring/12-implementation-plan.md) document.
