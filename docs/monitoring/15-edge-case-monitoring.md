# Edge Case Monitoring

## Resilience Testing

Chaos engineering principles are employed to verify system resilience:

1. **Synthetic Failures**: Periodic simulated failures of various components
2. **Service Degradation**: Testing behavior during partial outages
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Monitoring system behavior under resource constraints

## Rare Event Monitoring

The system monitors and handles rare but critical events:

1. **Data Corruption**: Detection of corrupt data formats or inconsistencies
2. **Security Breaches**: Unusual access patterns or authentication attempts
3. **Provider Outages**: Complete failure of third-party LLM providers
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Critical resource depletion events

## Edge Case Database Management

The system monitors database edge cases and anomalies:

1. **Query Complexity**: Tracking and alerting on excessively complex queries
2. **Schema Changes**: Monitoring unexpected schema changes
3. **Data Volume Spikes**: Detecting unusual increases in data volume
4. **Transaction Duration**: Alerting on unusually long transactions

## Resource Limit Monitoring

The system monitors resource limits and potential exhaustion:

1. **Memory Ceiling**: Tracking approach to memory limits
2. **Connection Pool Saturation**: Monitoring database connection usage
3. **Rate Limit Approach**: Tracking API rate limit consumption
4. **Storage Capacity**: Monitoring disk space usage

## Dependency Failure Handling

The system monitors and manages third-party dependency failures:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms when dependencies fail
2. **Circuit Breaking**: Preventing cascading failures
3. **Health Monitoring**: Tracking dependency availability
4. **Retry Policies**: Smart retry strategies for transient failures

## Extreme Load Testing

The system is tested under extreme load conditions:

1. **Load Testing**: Simulating high user concurrency
2. **Stress Testing**: Pushing the system beyond normal operating capacity
3. **Soak Testing**: Testing system behavior under sustained load
4. **Spike Testing**: Testing system response to sudden traffic spikes

## Recovery Testing

The system is tested for recovery capabilities:

1. **Disaster Recovery**: Testing recovery from catastrophic failures
2. **Data Recovery**: Verifying data backup and restoration
3. **Service Recovery**: Testing automated service recovery
4. **Regional Failover**: Testing cross-region failover mechanisms
