# Monitoring and Observability Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the monitoring and observability strategy for the ColonyCraft AI platform. Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining system reliability, performance, and security while providing insights into user behavior and application health.

## Monitoring Pillars

Our monitoring strategy is built on four key pillars:

1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Tracking the health and performance of servers, containers, and cloud resources
2. **Application Monitoring**: Measuring the performance and reliability of application components
3. **User Experience Monitoring**: Understanding how users interact with the system
4. **Security Monitoring**: Detecting and responding to suspicious activities
