## Authentication

### JWT-based Authentication

**Decision**: Selected for API authentication.

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. **Session-based Authentication**
   - Pros: Simpler to implement, easier to revoke
   - Cons: Requires server-side storage, scaling challenges
   - Why not chosen: Stateless JWT better fits our distributed architecture

2. **OAuth 2.0 Provider**
   - Pros: Standardized flow, common for SSO
   - Cons: More complex to implement initially
   - Why not chosen: Current scope doesn't require SSO, though may be added later

## Database

### PostgreSQL

**Decision**: Selected as the primary database.

**Pros**:
- ACID compliance and reliability
- Advanced features (JSON support, full-text search)
- Excellent performance and scalability
- Strong community and documentation
- Good support for array and enum types

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. **MongoDB**
   - Pros: Schema flexibility, horizontal scaling
   - Cons: Less strict consistency guarantees
   - Why not chosen: Our data model benefits from relational structure

2. **MySQL/MariaDB**
   - Pros: Wide adoption, good performance
   - Cons: Fewer advanced features than PostgreSQL
   - Why not chosen: PostgreSQL offers better JSON capabilities and type system

## Caching

### Redis

**Decision**: Selected for caching and rate limiting.
